# SavvyCal Appointments Developer Docs

If you are a software developer looking to build on top of SavvyCal Appointments, you've come to the right place. This documentation will guide you through the process of integrating the SavvyCal Appointments Platform into your application.

## REST API

The SavvyCal Appointments API adheres to [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer) conventions. Our API communicates in JSON format and uses [bearer tokens](/authentication) to authenticate requests. We take an additive approach; new fields may be added to existing payload types as we expand the API.

The server-side REST API is available at:

```
https://api.savvycal.app/
```
