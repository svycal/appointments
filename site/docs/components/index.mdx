# Components

SavvyCal Components are designed to be copied and pasted directly into your application, similar to modern UI kits like [Catalyst](https://catalyst.tailwindui.com/) and [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/). This allows you to weave SavvyCal-powered functionality seamlessly into your existing UI, without resorting to messy CSS overrides to force third-party elements to look like your own.

## Prerequisites

We've build the components to require minimal external dependencies.

- **Tailwind CSS**: Components are styled with Tailwind CSS.
- **React**: Components are built with React. We may support other frameworks in the future.
- **TanStack Query**: Components use [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/docs) for data fetching.

## Prepare your app

### Install dependencies

Add the following dependencies to your project:

```bash
npm install clsx @tanstack/react-query \
  @savvycal/appointments-core @savvycal/appointments-react-query \
  @savvycal/appointments-utils
```

### Set up your app root

Ensure the `<QueryClientProvider>` and `<SavvyCalProvider>` components are present in your app's root component.

If you are making requests to API endpoints that require authentication, you'll need to pass the `fetchAccessToken` prop to the `<SavvyCalProvider>` component. This should be a function that returns a JSON Web Token (JWT) generated by your backend for the user who is currently authenticated ([see docs on how to construct JWTs](https://developers.savvycal.app/authentication#json-web-tokens)). Since JWTs are short-lived, `fetchAccessToken` will be called any time the token expires.

If you're only making requests to public endpoints, you can omit the `fetchAccessToken` prop.

```tsx
// src/App.tsx

import { useMemo } from "react";
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from "@tanstack/react-query";
import { SavvyCalProvider } from "@savvycal/appointments-react-query";

const queryClient = new QueryClient();

function App() {
  const fetchAccessToken = useMemo(async () => {
    const response = await fetch("/access_token");

    if (!response.ok) {
      const { error } = await response.json();
      console.error("An error occurred: ", error);
      return undefined;
    } else {
      const { accessToken } = await response.json();
      return accessToken;
    }
  }, []);

  return (
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
      <SavvyCalProvider fetchAccessToken={fetchAccessToken}>
        {/* ... */}
      </SavvyCalProvider>
    </QueryClientProvider>
  );
}
```
