# Public Booking Form

A basic public booking form component.

## Live Demo

<ComponentDemo route="public-booking-form" />

## Prerequisites

Follow the instructions to [prepare your app](/components#prerequisites). This component requires a few additional dependencies:

- `lucide-react` (icons)
- `radix-ui` (radio group)
- `react-day-picker` (calendar)

Run the following command to install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install lucide-react radix-ui react-day-picker
```

Add the base styles for React Day Picker to your app styles:

```css
@import "react-day-picker/style.css" layer(components);
```

## Authentication

Since this component only uses public API endpoints, the `fetchAccessToken` prop is not required on `SavvyCalProvider`.

## Code

Create a new file called `public-booking-form.tsx` in your app's components directory:

<CodeBlock language="tsx">{PublicBookingFormSource}</CodeBlock>
